## 2. Before Applying



### 2.1 English Profeciency

You need to be proficient in English to be able to pass the TOEFL exam and to be successful at BYU Idaho.

Depending on your level of experience / confidence you can take one of the English Connect courses.



English Connect Program - https://www.englishconnect.org/courses



### 2.2 Financial Preparation

You will need to provide after being pre-approved the amount of $4,000.

That's the foreign deposit. The University requires this money for any international student, before releasing the I-20 Form, that you'll need to file a request for the F-1 visa.

Be prepared to have this amount of money. And also to pay for the SEVIS Tax ($350) and for the F1 tax ($200).

If you're going with any dependents you will need to pay $200 for each for the F2 tax.

Also you need to be prepared to pay for the flight to Rexburg Idaho and for the safe deposit needed for renting a spot to live while on the campus.



### 2.3 Find a Sponsor

Currently (in 2024) BYU Idaho requires you to have a sponsor with the amount of $17,000 / year during the amount of year you plan to study at the Campus.

4 Years = $68,000.

If you go with any dependents (wife / kids), you need to include on the total amount $4,500 for each dependent per year.

E.G.: Student + wife + 1 kid

$17,000 + $4,500 + $4,500 * 4 (years on campus) => $104,000



It's very expensive the price for LATAM, so make sure you can find someone with that amount willing to be your sponsor.

You can have more then one sponsor to reach the total amount needed.
